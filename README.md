# About Me :wave: :sunglasses:

My playground is at the exciting crossroads of biology and technology, where I develop small scripts for microscopy image analysis, including fluorescent, phase, and DIC microscopy :microscope: :chart_with_upwards_trend:. It's all about making the intricate world of bio-imaging a tad bit easier to navigate and put data into interoperable formats to get the best out of currently developed tools :hammer_and_wrench:.

But don't let the tech talk fool you! When I unplug, I'm an outdoor junkie who loves to feel the adrenaline rush while rock climbing :mountain:, find peace in nature through backpacking :walking:, or paddle away in a kayak :canoe:. Feel free to join me on either journey! :earth_americas:

# :rocket: Technologies I'm Learning

# :man_technologist: Work Experience

Having spent several years in the field of bio-imaging, I've gained valuable experience in several areas:

- Image acquisition and processing
- Development of AI-based pipelines for image analysis
- Collaborating with interdisciplinary teams
- Statistical analysis and data visualization

# :briefcase: Open for Opportunities

:alarm_clock: Expected to complete my PhD in the fall, I am actively seeking opportunities where I can apply and expand my skills. Particularly interested in roles that intersect medicine and medical research, software development, and image analysis. Let's discuss how I can contribute to your team! :handshake:

# :mailbox: Contact

I'm always eager to collaborate with others, particularly scientists, biologists, or software developers. If you're interested in image analysis or just want to discuss ideas, feel free to get in touch! :smile:
