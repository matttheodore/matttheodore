# About Me :wave: :sunglasses:

My playground is at the exciting crossroads of biology and technology, where I develop small scripts for microscopy image analysis, including fluorescent, phase, and DIC microscopy :microscope: :chart_with_upwards_trend:. It's all about making the intricate world of bio-imaging a tad bit easier to navigate and put data into interoperable formats to get the best out of currently developed tools :hammer_and_wrench:.

But don't let the tech talk fool you! When I unplug, I'm an outdoor junkie who loves to feel the adrenaline rush while rock climbing :mountain:, find peace in nature through backpacking :walking:, or paddle away in a kayak :canoe:. Feel free to join me on either journey! :earth_americas:

:handshake: I'm always eager to collaborate with others, particularly scientists, biologists, or software developers. If you're interested in image analysis or just want to discuss ideas, feel free to get in touch! :smile:
